# Data Structures and Algorithms
 Implementations of various algorithms/data structures.

 # Purpose
Welcome to my recreation project focused on data structures and algorithms! As a student at Florida State University (FSU), I've embarked on this journey to not only deepen my understanding of these fundamental concepts but also to provide a simple and accessible resource for fellow students and learners.

## Why Recreate Data Structures and Algorithms?

1) Learning Reinforcement: Recreating data structures and algorithms is an active learning approach. By coding them from scratch, I'm reinforcing my understanding of how they work and how they're implemented.
2) Deeper Understanding: While textbooks and lectures provide a theoretical foundation, practical implementation deepens comprehension. By recreating these structures and algorithms, I'm gaining insights into their intricacies and nuances.
3) Study Aid: As a student, I understand the challenges of grasping complex topics. Hence, my recreation project serves as a study aid not only for myself but also for fellow students at FSU and beyond. I aim to simplify these concepts and make them easier to digest.
4) Accessible Learning: Learning data structures and algorithms can be intimidating, especially for beginners. Through this project, I'm striving to offer a user-friendly and straightforward resource that anyone can access and understand, regardless of their background or expertise level.
